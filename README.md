# Decentralized Kudumbashree (D-KUDUMBASHREE)

## Note
- This web application runs on Ethereum Holesky Network. Make sure you have an Metamask extension installed and set the network to Holesky Testnet to avaid unexpected errors.
- This version of D Kudumbashree removes the restriction on CDS Admin dashboard and it is accessesable by all addresses. Actually CDS Admin is the one who deployed the contract and CDS Dashboard is accessable only to that address.

## Introduction
D-Kudumbashree represents an initiative to decentralize one of Asiaâ€™s largest Self-Help Groups (SHGs), Kudumbashree. This project aims to redistribute authority from the SHG president to its members using blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and democratization of processes.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Based Voting:** Enables democratic loan approvals and presidential elections within the SHG.
- **Automated Meeting Documentation:** Utilizes a chatbot to generate accurate minutes of meetings.

## Technology Stack
